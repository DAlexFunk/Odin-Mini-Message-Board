# Odin-Mini-Message-Board
The Mini Message Board project from The Odin Project

## Description
This is the Mini Message Board project from The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to practice using Express and NodeJS as a backend server for a website. Everything about the site is using Node and Express and files are layed out with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

## Use
* The site can be accessed [here](https://weird-dorree-alex-funk-projects-a0c238cc.koyeb.app/messages).
* The design is simple because that was not the focus of the project.
* The main page will be populated with 2 default messages.
* View full message content by clicking the corresponding button.
* Add a new message by clicking the add new message button.
* Fill out the form (each have a minimum length of 1) and click submit and see your message populated to the screen.

## Credits

* [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/) for serving as the PaaS for this project and hosting both the site and the database.
